# Symptoms
Motor Symptoms: Tremors, bradykinesia (slowness), muscle rigidity, postural instability, and freezing of gait.
Non-Motor Symptoms: Cognitive decline, depression, sleep disturbances, constipation, and loss of smell.

# Causes & Risk Factors
Genetic Mutations: SNCA, LRRK2, and PARKIN genes.
Environmental Triggers: Pesticides, heavy metals, and head trauma.
Aging: Common in people over 60.

# Diagnosis
PD is diagnosed based on clinical symptoms, medical history, and response to dopaminergic drugs. Imaging techniques like MRI and DaTscan help rule out other conditions.

# Treatment
    Medications: Levodopa, dopamine agonists, MAO-B inhibitors.
    Therapies: Physical therapy, speech therapy, and deep brain stimulation (DBS) for advanced cases.
    Lifestyle: Regular exercise, diet, and cognitive training improve quality of life.
