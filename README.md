# PARKINSON DISEASE 
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects movement. It is caused by the loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra, a region of the brain responsible for motor control. The exact cause of this neuronal loss is still unknown, but genetic and environmental factors are believed to play a role.

# Symptoms
![image alt](https://github.com/AManan651/public_ML-Parkinson_model-/blob/main/parkinson-disease-symptoms-infographic_1308-48394.jpg?raw=true) <br>
Motor Symptoms: Tremors, bradykinesia (slowness), muscle rigidity, postural instability, and freezing of gait.<br>
Non-Motor Symptoms: Cognitive decline, depression, sleep disturbances, constipation, and loss of smell.

# Causes & Risk Factors
Genetic Mutations: SNCA, LRRK2, and PARKIN genes.<br>
Environmental Triggers: Pesticides, heavy metals, and head trauma.<br>
Aging: Common in people over 60.

# Diagnosis
PD is diagnosed based on clinical symptoms, medical history, and response to dopaminergic drugs. Imaging techniques like MRI and DaTscan help rule out other conditions.

# Treatment
    Medications: Levodopa, dopamine agonists, MAO-B inhibitors.<br>
    Therapies: Physical therapy, speech therapy, and deep brain stimulation (DBS) for advanced cases.<br>
    Lifestyle: Regular exercise, diet, and cognitive training improve quality of life.
